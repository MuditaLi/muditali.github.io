## Why FinDS ?

Data Scientist is being highly demanding by all kinds of companies, consulting, banks, 
hospital, college, internet, etc. Most of the time, people with data science background
feel hard to squeeze themselves into specific industry. Well, same awkward situation also happened 
on expertises who want to blend data science skills into their jobs.

property. The speed of packages/APIs/APPs generation is way faster than school education cycle,

apply this skill into your career ASAP.

their application tools constantly to catch up with the pace of new tech. Besides that,
most of the society education institute are focusing on basic knowledge, people with some knowledge
