hospital, college, internet, etc. Most of the time, people with data science background
feel hard to squeeze themselves into specific industry. Well, same awkward situation also happened 
on expertises who want to blend data science skills into their jobs.

property. The speed of packages/APIs/APPs generation is way faster than school education cycle,
the input-output ratio for data science education in school becomes really low if you want to 
apply this skill into your career ASAP.
